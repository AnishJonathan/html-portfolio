<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is M. Anish Jonathan, and I'm currently a B.Tech student in my 2nd year, 1st semester, specializing in Computer Science and Engineering at Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad (JNTUH). Situated in Kukatpally, Hyderabad, JNTUH has provided me with a solid foundation in the field of computer science.</p>

<p>I have a keen interest in web development and software engineering, and I'm eager to explore and master these areas further. Currently, I'm working on a project to develop my personal portfolio using HTML. This project is an exciting opportunity for me to apply my skills and showcase my work.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I enjoy playing and watching sports. My favorite sports include football, cricket, and Formula 1. These interests keep me balanced and motivated as I work towards my goals in the tech industry.</p>
